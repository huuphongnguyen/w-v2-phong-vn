  "project-axembroidery-letter-p1": "Embroidery is a wonderful story, and I truly appreciate and love this field. Embroidery has made my life much better, it also made me interested and has a great passion for fashion. The feeling of holding an embroidery pattern after it is finished on the machine is a great feeling, it is like enjoying wine while it is being brewed in a barrel.",
  "project-axembroidery-letter-p2": "My mother spent 15 years working as a worker in an embroidery factory, and you know it was a long and really hard time. And AX is another chapter in my mother's life. This project went through 5 years before it was symbolized and branded by me - my mother - and other very cool people at AX. This is not only a project but also a blessing, a passion, and a part of my family's life."
