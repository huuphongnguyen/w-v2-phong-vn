  "domains-letter": "Sometimes when I have a good idea or need to relieve stress, one of the things I often do is buy a domain. Some domains are later used in my projects, some domains that I forgot I owned. Most of these domains are associated with good moments and memories that I have, and sometimes I leave it as part of accepting to forget those things."
